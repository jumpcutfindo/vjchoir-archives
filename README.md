# The VJChoir Archives repository

Hello, welcome to the repository of the archives. I'm just writing this for any future / personal reference so doesn't really matter what I type here I guess lol.

## Setup process
1. Run the following code to set up:
```
npm install
```

2. Run the following to create a client on localhost:
```
ng serve --open
```
Note: the `--open` parameter will open the site on your primary browser.

## Build process
1. Do coding here
2. Build using the following command:
   ```
    ng build --prod --base-href="https://vjchoir.github.io/"
   ```
3. Copy paste production into vjchoir.github.io repo (make sure not to replace files not meant to be replaced, such as 404.html and also make sure you keep the redirect script in index.html)
4. Publish
