# The VJChoir Archives repository

Hello, welcome to the repository of the archives. I'm just writing this for any future / personal reference so doesn't really matter what I type here I guess lol.

## Build process
1. Do coding here
2. Build using the following command:
   ```
    ng build --prod --base-href="https://vjchoir.github.io/"
   ```
3. Copy paste production into vjchoir.github.io repo (make sure not to replace files not meant to be replaced, such as 404.html and also make sure you keep the redirect script in index.html)
4. Publish
