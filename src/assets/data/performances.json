This page attempts to archive information relating to those performances by keeping any recordings, video links, photos etc.</br></br>This page is pretty new, and being not-in-choir right now has kind of put a wrench in the plan to gather all the possible media relating to both newer and older performances. Hopefully, in time, this page will become more populated with that kind of stuff, but in the meantime I would be very grateful to anyone who has information related to any past performances and can help to contribute it! Please send over whatever content you may have (e.g. recordings, videos, images, repertoires, booklets, pamphlets) and I can help to populate this part of the website accordingly! Thank you!</p>"
